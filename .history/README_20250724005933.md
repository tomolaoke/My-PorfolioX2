# 🎨 My Portfolio — Built with Next.js

Welcome to my portfolio! This project is powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It's designed to showcase who I am, what I build, and how I think — all in a sleek, modern web experience.
